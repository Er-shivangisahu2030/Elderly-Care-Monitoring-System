## Features
- **Fall Detection**: Automatically detects fall incidents
- **Multi-class Classification**: Distinguishes between Fall, Standing, and Sitting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Interactive dashboard for live predictions
- **High Accuracy**: Deep learning model based on ResNet50
- **Visual Analytics**: Comprehensive data visualization and reporting

## Dataset
- **Training Samples**: 374 images
- **Test Samples**: 111 images
- **Classes**:
  - Class 0: Fall (Emergency)
  - Class 1: Standing (Normal)
  - Class 2: Sitting (Normal)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install pandas numpy pillow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tqdm
pip install streamlit plotly
```

## Usage

### 1. Train the Model
Run the training script to create the fall detection model:

```bash
python train_fall_detection_model.py
```

**Training Parameters:**
- Epochs: 50
- Batch Size: 16
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Image Size: 224x224
- Optimizer: Adam with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler

**Model Architecture:**
- Base: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- Custom Classification Head: 512 neurons with dropout
- Output: 3 classes

The trained model will be saved to:
```
E:\\PROJECT FILE\\PROJECT 3-ELDER CARE ASSISTENCE AND MONITORING SYSTEM\\models\\fall_detection_model.pth
```

### 2. Make Predictions
Use the inference script to make predictions on new images:

```python
from predict_fall_detection import load_model, predict_image

# Load model
model, class_names = load_model(MODEL_PATH)

# Predict single image
pred_class, confidence, probabilities, error = predict_image(
    image_path="path/to/image.jpg",
    model=model,
    class_names=class_names
)

print(f"Prediction: {pred_class}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence*100:.2f}%")
```

### 3. Launch Dashboard
Start the interactive monitoring dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard provides:
- **Dashboard Overview**: System statistics and class distribution
- **Live Prediction**: Upload images for real-time fall detection
- **Dataset Analysis**: Explore training and test data
- **Model Performance**: View model metrics and accuracy

## Dashboard Features

- Training and test set statistics
- Class distribution visualization
- System status monitoring

### 2. Live Prediction
- Upload images for instant analysis
- Real-time fall detection
- Confidence scores and probability distributions
- Visual alerts for fall incidents

### 3. Dataset Analysis
- Sample data exploration
- Class distribution statistics
- Training/test split information

### 4. Model Performance
- Architecture details
- Training configuration
- Accuracy gauge
- Performance metrics

## Model Details

### Architecture
- **Base Model**: ResNet50 (pre-trained)
- **Fine-tuned Layers**: Last 20 layers unfrozen
- **Custom Head**: 
  - Linear(2048 -> 512)
  - ReLU
  - Dropout(0.5)
  - Linear(512 -> 3)

### Data Augmentation

- Random horizontal flip
- Random rotation (±10°)
- Color jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation)
- Normalization (ImageNet statistics)

### Loss Function
- CrossEntropyLoss for multi-class classification

### Optimizer
- Adam with learning rate 0.001
- ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler (patience=5, factor=0.5)

## Expected Results

Based on the dataset:
- **Training Set**: 374 samples
  - Fall: 207 samples (55.3%)
  - Standing: 79 samples (21.1%)
  - Sitting: 88 samples (23.5%)

- **Test Set**: 111 samples
  - Fall: 72 samples (64.9%)
  - Standing: 22 samples (19.8%)
  - Sitting: 17 samples (15.3%)

**Target Accuracy**: >85% on validation set

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found Error
Ensure you run the training script first:
```bash
python train_fall_detection_model.py
```

### Image Loading Errors
Check that image paths in CSV files are correct and images exist at those locations.

### CUDA Out of Memory
Reduce batch size in training script:
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 8  # Reduce from 16
```

### Dependencies Issues
Install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Accuracy:
1. Increase training epochs
2. Add more data augmentation
3. Fine-tune more layers
4. Experiment with learning rate
5. Use class weights for imbalanced data

### For Faster Training:
1. Use GPU (CUDA)
2. Increase batch size (if memory permits)
3. Reduce image size
4. Use mixed precision training

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Video stream support for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Alert system with email/SMS notifications
- [ ] Multi-camera support
- [ ] Historical incident tracking
- [ ] Integration with emergency services
- [ ] Mobile app for caregivers
- [ ] Cloud deployment

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This system is designed to assist caregivers but should not replace human supervision. Always have proper emergency protocols in place.
